AIIMS Patna, conducted a two-day Supervisor Training on Verbal Autopsy (VA) for SRS supervisors in Bihar, in collaboration with ORGI and medical network partners.

Supervisors—classified as new and experienced based on past trainings—were guided on conducting VA interviews, maintaining data quality, and understanding their key responsibilities. The sessions included practical demonstrations, role-plays, and discussions on field challenges.

The training strengthened supervisors’ skills in collecting accurate mortality data, ensuring better quality for India’s health statistics and supporting evidence-based public health planning.
