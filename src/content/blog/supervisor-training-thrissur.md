Government Medical College, Thrissur conducted a Supervisor’s Training Program to strengthen the skills of SRS supervisors involved in Verbal Autopsy (VA). The training, supported by the AIIMS Technical Support Unit (ATSU) and ORGI, focused on improving interview techniques, ensuring high-quality data collection, and enhancing supervisors’ understanding of their field responsibilities.

Participants were grouped as new and experienced supervisors, and the two-day program included practical demonstrations, role-plays, and detailed guidance on conducting sensitive VA interviews. The training helped supervisors improve accuracy, communication, and overall workflow in mortality data collection.

This initiative reinforces the commitment of GMC Thrissur and ATSU toward improving the quality of VA data and supporting better public health planning.
